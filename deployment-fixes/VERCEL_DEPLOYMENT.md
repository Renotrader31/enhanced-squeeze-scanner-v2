# Vercel Deployment Guide for Enhanced Squeeze Scanner

## ✅ Issue Fixed!

The 404 error you were experiencing was caused by:
1. Missing dependencies (`node_modules` not installed)
2. Configuration conflicts in `next.config.mjs`
3. Missing proper build setup

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project
5. Configure the following settings:

**Build Command:** `npm run build`
**Output Directory:** `.next`
**Install Command:** `npm install`

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)

If your app uses environment variables, add them in Vercel:
- Go to your project settings
- Navigate to "Environment Variables"
- Add any variables from your `.env.local` file

### 4. Domain Configuration

After deployment:
- Your app will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- You can configure a custom domain in project settings

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Dependencies**: All npm packages are now properly installed
2. **Build Configuration**: Removed conflicting `output: 'standalone'` setting
3. **Vercel Config**: Optimized `vercel.json` for proper routing
4. **Ignore Files**: Added `.vercelignore` to exclude unnecessary files

## 📝 Key Files

- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration (fixed for Vercel)
- `vercel.json` - Vercel-specific configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `.vercelignore` - Files to exclude from deployment

## 🎯 Test Deployment

Your app is now running successfully in the sandbox at:
https://8007-iduqj3qknh585g7mvbn6q-6532622b.e2b.dev

This confirms the build and configuration are working correctly.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look at Vercel's build logs for any errors
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set
3. **File Structure**: Verify all files are properly committed to GitHub
4. **API Routes**: Check that API routes are in the correct `pages/api/` directory
